# OmenBot
A personal Discord.py bot that plays music, funny Valorant sound effects and fetches random information from APIs.

Notably, the bot can play music using Youtube URLs or can search Youtube for a query instead and play the top video

This isn't exactly a bot you can clone and run, but there's a lot of Discord.py functionality that I figured out traversing tutorials and Stack Overflow

If you want to make a bot that can:

1.  Join and leave channels,
2.  Play music from Youtube using URLS and search queries,
3.  Respond to messages in Discord text channels,
4.  Play sound effects,
5.  Have help text, aliases on commands, and options passed into commands,

then have a look at src/OmenBot.py
